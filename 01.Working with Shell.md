## 💻 Linux Shell Commands and Directory Management

This note summarizes common Linux shell commands used for directory navigation, creation, manipulation, and deletion, based on a practical, step-by-step lab exercise.

### 1. Identifying the Home Directory

The home directory for a user, such as `bob`, is typically located at `/home/bob`.

### 2. Viewing the Home Directory Path

The most common way to display the current user's home directory path using a shell command is by echoing the `$HOME` environment variable

**Command:** `echo $HOME`

### 3. Command Syntax: Arguments

In a command structure like `echo hello_user`, the word **`hello_user`** represents the **argument** with respect to the `echo` command.

### 4. Command Type: `git`

The `git` command is classified as a **file** command, meaning it is an executable program file located in the filesystem.

### 5. Creating a Single Directory

To create a single directory like `/home/bob/birds`, you use the `mkdir` command

**Command:** `mkdir /home/bob/birds`

### 6. Creating Nested Directories (Using `-p` option)

To create a directory structure where parent directories may not yet exist (e.g., creating both `/home/bob/fish` and `/home/bob/fish/salmon` in one command), use the **`-p`** option (for *parents*) with `mkdir`[cite: 12]:
**Command:** `mkdir -p /home/bob/fish/salmon`

### 7. Creating Multiple Directories

The following commands use `mkdir -p` to create various directories and their necessary parent structure based on the provided file system diagram:

* `mkdir -p /home/bob/mammals/elephant` 
* `mkdir -p /home/bob/mammals/monkey` 
* `mkdir /home/bob/birds/eagle` 
* `mkdir -p /home/bob/reptile/snake` [
* `mkdir -p /home/bob/reptile/frog` 
* `mkdir -p /home/bob/amphibian/salamander` 

### 8. Moving a Directory

The `mv` (move) command is used to move a directory from one location to another

**Task:** Move the directory `frog` from `reptile` to `amphibian`

**Command:** `mv /home/bob/reptile/frog /home/bob/amphibian`

### 9. Renaming a Directory

The `mv` command is also used for renaming files and directories

**Rename the directory `snake` to `crocodile`

**Syntax:** `mv [current_name] [new_name]` 

**Command:** `mv /home/bob/reptile/snake /home/bob/reptile/crocodile` 

### 10. Deleting a Directory and its Contents

To delete a directory and all of its contents (recursively and forcibly), use the `rm` (remove) command with the **`-rf`** options

**Task:** Delete the directory `reptile` along with its contents.

**Command:** `rm -rf reptile`
